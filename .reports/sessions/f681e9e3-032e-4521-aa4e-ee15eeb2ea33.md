# Session 2026-02-22 -- PR Creation (f681e9e3)

**Session ID:** f681e9e3-032e-4521-aa4e-ee15eeb2ea33
**Date:** 2026-02-22 (continuation from 2026-02-21)
**Branch:** feat/python-rewrite

## Summary

Continuation session from context compaction. Pushed feat/python-rewrite branch to origin (13 commits ahead of main) and created PR #5 on GitHub. All adversarial review findings (H1-H3, M1-M8) already fixed in previous compacted session (78096ea). PR includes comprehensive test plan with 18 commits, 76 files changed, ~10,400 lines added.

## What Was Done

1. Resumed from compacted session -- previous session completed adversarial review, fixed all HIGH/MEDIUM findings (H1-H3, M1-M8), implemented author canonicalization, data quality verification, year-as-edition subfolders, and committed as 78096ea
2. Pushed feat/python-rewrite branch to origin with `git push -u origin feat/python-rewrite`
3. Created PR #5 on GitHub: "feat: Python rewrite with AI-assisted organize pipeline"
   - Used `gh pr create` with comprehensive summary and test plan
   - PR includes all 18 commits from feat/python-rewrite branch
   - Stats: 76 files changed, ~10,400 lines added
   - URL: https://github.com/rodaddy/audiobook-pipeline/pull/5

## Files Changed

None. This session was purely git push + PR creation.

## Decisions Made

- PR created against main from feat/python-rewrite
- PR title: "feat: Python rewrite with AI-assisted organize pipeline"
- All 18 commits included in the PR (full rewrite scope)
- Test plan included in PR body (15 items covering organize, reorganize, convert, edge cases)

## Known Issues / Blockers

- None. All HIGH/MEDIUM findings fixed, 324 tests passing
- False positive in verify: Cixin Liu / Ken Liu flagged as author variation (different people sharing surname)
- Symlinked dirs not followed by os.walk() -- by design (followlinks=True risks infinite loops)

## Learnings

- Context compaction worked seamlessly for large sessions -- orchestrator summarized previous work, this agent resumed cleanly
- PR creation flow: push branch first (with -u), then use gh pr create with HEREDOC for body formatting

## Next Session

### Carry-forward

- PR is live and awaiting review: https://github.com/rodaddy/audiobook-pipeline/pull/5
- Consider addressing LOW findings from adversarial review if desired (L1-L6, UI1-UI4)
- Monitor for any review feedback on the PR

### New from this session

- Branch pushed to origin, tracking remote configured
- PR #5 created with full context and test plan
- Python rewrite is now formally proposed for merge to main
