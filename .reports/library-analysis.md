## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions

1. **Process the 38 "Not in Library" items** -- these are confirmed new content
2. **Manually verify the 6 High Confidence matches** before deciding whether to process
3. **Investigate the 7 Ambiguous items** to determine overlap

### Special Cases Requiring Manual Review

- **Andrew Rowe, John Gwynne, Tad Williams, B. T. Narro, R.A. Salvatore**: Author exists in library but may have incomplete series
- **Books for Others, Random Rico Books**: Generic folders -- need content inspection
- **Brent Weeks**: Folder may contain multiple series beyond what's in library

### Duplicates Between Original/ and NewBooks/

The following appear in BOTH source directories:
- Ann Leckie - The Raven Tower
- Deathgate Cycle Volumes 1 - 7
- Glen Cook - The Black Company
- Harry Potter Collection
- Jenn Lyons - A Chorus of Dragons (already in library)
- Joe Abercrombie
- Justing Cronin - The Passage Trilogy
- Kingkiller Chronicles
- Lord Of The Rings
- Orson Scott Card Collection
- Tad Williams (All Chaptered)
- The First Law Standalones
- The First Law Trilogy
- The Hungry City Chronicles
- The Rhythm of Rivalry - B. T. Narro

**Action:** Choose which source directory to process from (recommend NewBooks/ if more recent/better quality)

---

## METHODOLOGY

**Matching Algorithm:**
- Fuzzy string matching using sequence similarity
- Author name normalization (punctuation, spacing)
- Title normalization (articles, case)
- Substring detection for series/collection names
- Manual verification of edge cases

**Confidence Levels:**
- **≥90%**: Exact match
- **70-89%**: Fuzzy match (likely but verify)
- **<70%**: No match or false positive

**Limitations:**
- Analysis based on folder names only (no audio file content verification)
- Cannot detect partial series completion
- Cannot detect different editions/narrators of same book
- Some false positives in fuzzy matching (e.g., "Chronicles" substring)
